     <h1>University At Albany Class of 2021</h1>
	<h2>Batchelors of Science</h2>
	<h3><br> Majored in Informatics<br>concentration in Interactive User Experience <br> and minor in Economics</h3>
	<p><b>In 2015,</b> I took an advanced class in high school that introduced me to computer programming. It was an introduction class to the language of Java. The whole process of learning and creating something from lines of code always blew my mind. From my first "Hello World" program to more advanced programs I use on an everyday basis. I found a passion in coding and creating things. Since then, I've been learning new things every day. <br><br><b>In 2016, </b> I started my journey at UAlbany declared as a Computer Engineering Major. After some consideration I decided to switch to Informatics because I would be able to continue coding along with knowledge in data analysis. Throughout my years at UAlbany, I was able to take a number of interesting classes. Learning skills that would teach me how to organize research, the use of multiple programs such as those in Adobe Creative Suite and Microsoft office, learning database structures and computer hardware. I also learned a number of computer programming languages including, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and more.<br><br><b>After graduating,</b> I decided to further my education in programming by taking online certification classes on the popular site Udemy. Currently I am enrolled in a number of online courses that i had found interesting including an intro to C#,a course on Raspberry pi, unity and a course in cyber security. <br><br> Personally I am a big believer that you should work for passion not a paycheck and that is exactly why I pursued computer programming.  </p>

     <h1>Manager of Technical Procedures</h1>

	<h3>Stage Door Deli and Boconcinis Deli and Pizza</h3>
	<p><b>While I was still in high school </b> I started working at a local deli after i was finished with my high school classes. The minimum wage job was enough to keep me satisfied with movie tickets, video games and applebee's appetizers for each upcoming weekend. At 16 years old for me, all I really concerned with was making money and hanging out with friends. <br> <br>Throughout my childhood, I was a very shy and introverted person. That would soon change after working at a busy and face paced deli in which I had little experience at the time. My ability to adapt and learn quickly would soon be a valuable asset to the team. With growing friendships with my coworkers and development of problem solving abilities I was able to make the most of this part time job before I left for my college years. I would soon return with the education to upgrade the business technology.<br><br> After I graduated, the deli had become pretty under staffed due to covid. Many people were staying home and business was down. I went back to work there to help out and give them a much needed upgrade. I was able to set up and fix a lot of their much needed technical problems. I was able to create the website that is linked to the icon as a final project for one of my classes. Later I would use the website for our main website link when searched online and even connect to a slice menu that I had set up. Setting up accounts with Uber Eats, Slice and more would not only be difficult for people in an older generation but the use of changing prices and contacting support when the internet would go down was a responsibility that would soon go to me. <br><br> With knowledge in graphic design, I was able to redesign their main breakfast menu to include prices that may be altered at a later time. While in charge of many day to day things at the deli, I was also head of the social media account on instagram and also the coordinator for their google business. <br><br> I have stayed with this business because they have given me many opportunities that a regular company may not have given me. I started there at around 16 years old riding my bike to and from work and now I have a lot of responsibilities that are useful to the team.  </p>

     <h1>Content UX Group Leader (Mobile Application </h1>
	<h2>January 2021 - May 2021</h2>
	<h3>ListeningHere</h3>
	<p><b>An internship </b>that I took in the beginning of the semester at UAlbany was working as a content creator for an app ListenHere. Listen Here was an interesting app that focused on mainly meditation. It allowed the user to explore their surroundings and listen to sounds that would mainly be missed if one was not listening closely. What my team contributed was we mainly worked on the HTML, CSS and the PHP portion for the user to track and save their locations to a database. As the leader of our project team and speaker for the team group, I was able to design an interactive page for the app. I was able to synchronize with other teams to create a well looking web page. While being the leader of my group I was incharge of keeping a log of our work schedule and trying to keep everyone on target. <br><br><b>I learned a lot </b> from this experience, and this introduction to PHP really started my grasp on the subject. I really enjoyed working during this period and it was a great opportunity to learn more about the development of mobile applications. I currently have a mobile game that I am working on and plan to release soon </p>

     <h1>UAS Equipment Considerations</h1>
	<h2>January 2021 - May 2021</h2>
		<h3>Capstone Project</h3>

		<p><b>New and emerging technology</b> has always been an interest to me so when I got this opportunity I was really excited to work with everyone. The project was an analysis and proposal to the Albany Fire department on the use of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS Equipment or Drones)  for various missions. The paper goes in depth to various cost analysis, safety protocols, flying laws and regulations, and plenty more. For this project I had the honor to work with a fantastic hard working team that was able to keep track of group meetings, focus on research, handling deadlines and maintaining communication throughout the project.
		<br> <b>Our proposal presentation</b> was given and I was able to volunteer to speak about a portion of our presentation. Overall, It was pretty exciting. I am very interested in technology that is just becoming mainstream. Tech like Drones, 3D printing, Virtual and augmented reality, and more, are all on the cutting edge and i'm very excited to see where this technology goes in the coming years. </p>
