     <h1>University At Albany Class of 2021</h1>
	<h2>Batchelors of Science</h2>
	<h3><br> Majored in Informatics<br>conentration in Interacvie User Experience <br> and minor in Economics</h3>
	<p><b>In 2015,</b> I took an advacned class in high school that introduced me to computer programing. It was an introduction class to the lanuage of Java. The whole proccess of learning and creating something from lines of code always blew my mind. From my first "Hello World" program to more advnaced progams I use on an everyday basis. I found a passion in coding and creating things. Since then, I've been learning new things every day. <br><br><b>In 2016, </b> I started my journy at UAlbany declared as a Computer Enginering Major. After some consideration I deceided to switch to Informatics beacause would be able to contuine coding along with knowldge in data analysis. Throughout my years at UAlbany, I was able to take a number of intresting classes. Learning skills that would teach me how to orgainze reasearch, the use of mutiple programs such as those in Adobe Creative Suite and Microsft office, learing database structers and computer hardware. I also learned a number of computer progarming languages icluding, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and more.<br><br><b>After graduating,</b> I decided to further my education in programing by taking online cerification classes on the popular site Udemy. Currenlty I am enrolled in a number of online courses that i had found intresting including an intro to C#,a course on Rasberry pi, unity and a course in cyber security. <br><br> Perosnally I am big belevier that you should work for passion not a paycheck and that is exactly why I persued computer programing.  </p>

     <h1>Manager of Technical Procedures</h1>

	<h3>Stage Door Deli and Boconcinis Deli and Pizza</h3>
	<p><b>While I was still in high school </b> I started working at a local deli after i was finished with my high school classes. The minimum wage job was enough to keep me satusifed with movie tickets, video games and applebees appitizers for each upcoming weekend. At 16 years old for me, all I really concerned with was making money and hanging out with friends. <br> <br>Thoughout my childhood, I was a very shy and introverted person. That would soon change after working at a busy and face paced deli in which i had little experiacne in at the time. My abitly to adapt and learn quickly I would soon be a vauleble asset to the team. With growing friendships with my coworkers and devoelpent of problem solving abilities i was able to make the most of this part time job before left for my college years. I would soon return with the education to upgrade the businiess techonolgy.<br><br> After I graduated, the deli had became pretty under staffed due to covid. Many people were stayting home and business was down. I went back to work there to helo out and give them a much needed upgrade. I was able to set up and fix alot of their much need techinal problems. I was able to create the website that is linked to the icon as a final project for one of my classes. Later i would use the website for our main website link when seaerched online and even connects to a slice menu that i had set up. Setting up accounts with Uber Eats, Slice and more would not only be difficult for people in an older generation but the use of changing prices and contacting support when the internet would go down was responiblites that would soon go to me. <br><br> With knowledge in graphic desgin, I was able to redesgin thier main breakfast menu to include prices that may be altered at a later time. While in charge of many day to day things at the deli, I was also head of the social media account on instagram and also the coordatier for their google business. <br><br> I have stayed with this business becuase they have given me many oppertuines that a reaular company may not have givien me. I started there at around 16 years old riding my bike to and from work and now i have a lot of resposibites that are useful to the team.  </p>

     <h1>Content UX Group Leader (Mobile Application </h1>
	<h2>January 2021 - May 2021</h2>
	<h3>ListenHere.com</h3>
	<p><b>An internship </b>that I took in the begining of the semester at UAlbany was working as a content creator for an app ListenHere. Listen Here was interesting app that foucsed on mainly meditation. It allowed the user to explore their sourroundings and listen to sounds that would maily be missed if one was not listening closely. What my team contributed was we maily worked on the HTML, CSS and the PHP portion for the user to track and save their locations to a database. As the leader of our project team and speaker for the team group, I was able to design an interactive page for the app. I was able to synchronize with outher teams to create a well looking web page. Whiile being the leader of my group i was incharge og keeping a log of our work schedule and trying to keep everyone on target. <br><br><b>I learned a lot </b> from this expericance, and this introduction to PHP really started my grasp on the subject. I really enjoied working during this period and was a great oppertunity to learn more about the development of mobile applications. I currently have a mobile game that I am working on and plan to release soon </p>

	<h2>January 2021 - May 2021</h2>
		<h3>Capstone Project</h3>

		<p><b>New and emerging technology</b> has always been an intrest to me so when I got this oppertunity I was really excited to work with everyone. The project was an anaalsis and propsoal to the Albany Fire departmnet on the use of Unmaned Aircraft System (UAS Equipment or Drones)  for various missions. The paper goes in depth to various cost anaylsis, saftey protocals, flying laws and regulations, and plenty more. For this project I had the honor to work with a fantasic hard working team that was able to keep track of group meetings, focus on research, handling deadlines and maintaing commuinication throughout the project.
		<br> <b>Our preposal presentaion</b> was given and I was able to volenture to speak about a portion of our presentation. Overall, It was pretty exciting. I am ver intrtested in technology that is just becoming main stream. Tech like Drones, 3D printing, Virtural and augmented reality, and more, are all on the cutting edge and im very excited to see where this technology goes in the coming years. </p>
