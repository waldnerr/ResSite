			<p class="para">Interests: Rasberrypi, Sports, 3D printing, Video Game Design, Graphic Design, Video and Photo Editing, Writing, Photography </p>
			<p class="para"><b>Programing</b> for me was not something I thought I'd see mself doing during my senoir year of high school. Having one foot out the door, finding a new intrest that did not involve video games was hard to belive at that time. Entering the class room and creating my first "Hello World" program felt like a big waste of time. However as time went on, and some interesting projects later, I found myself creating programs and enjoying the feeling of building something from nothing.  </p>
			<p class="para"> <b>Graphic design</b> for me goes hand and hand with Front End Development. Using Adobe software is a major advantage when it comes to designing icons and buttons for a webpage. Learning how to use softwares like Illustrator and Photoshop only furthered my interest in Web Development</p>
			<p class="para"> <b>Sports</b>, either playing one or rooting for a team, have always been a huge influance on my life and how I grew up. Playing a team sport, I was able to grow up learning the values of working together, handling defeat and handeling victory. Knowing my role and fufiling my duty was all a part of the job as a member of a team.  </p>
